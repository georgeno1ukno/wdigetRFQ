# RFQ Widget Processing Application

## Overview

This project is a full-stack application for processing Requests for Quotes (RFQs) for a metal service center. It leverages the latest AI tools to automatically convert customer RFQ emails into structured quotes, enabling salespeople simulate to respond with a single click. The application includes a backend server for handling RFQ processing and a frontend application for submitting RFQ emails, viewing quotes, and finalizing quotes.

This implementation doesn't have connection to DB for manage Inventory. It's using a dummy implementation for inventory stock and prices.
